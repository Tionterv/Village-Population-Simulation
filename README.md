# Village-Population-Simulation
A small simulation game of a village. The objective of the game is to climb through the ranks of  this population from [settlers] to [country]. The player will be given the choice based on each  day and seasonâ€™s scenarios. Depending on the choices the player makes and its sequence, it  will impact the population, food, materials, and conflicts. Therefore, to level up through each  rank, you must increase and maintain the population number and food to material ratio  objectively.
